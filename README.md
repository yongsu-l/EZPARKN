This project is to provide a parking reservation service for the students at City College.
We aim to partner students at our college together as a team so that a student is provided with a guaranteed parking spot in a reasonable amount of time.

We intend to produce as our miminum viable product:
* The ability for a user to "sign in" to an area and search for parking on our app or website before they arrive or once they arrive. 
* A listing of all the users who are already parked, with information concerning car location/characteristics and arrival/departure times.
* A queue of users that may be waiting, to be prioritized first when a spot is close to open.
* The ability for users to communicate with each other to set up "reservations" to ensure a spot at a specific time.
* The ability to see street parking rules, misc events that are occuring on certain streets.


## Technologies
This rough draft is using what is known as a MEAN stack, which uses the following technologies:
+ MySql
  * A relational database management system. 
+ NodeJS
  * A JavaScript run-time environment for executing server-side scripts using native JavaScript, it is commonly used for web development purposes.
